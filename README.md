## Playing around
Will expand on this soon.

## Quickstart

To get started:

```bash
npm install
npm run-script start
```

the start command will give you a network path to the app, in chrome that seems to be he best way to get it to run.

## Scripts

- `start` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes
- `start:build` runs your app after it has been built using the build command
- `build` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory
- `test` runs your test suite with Web Test Runner
- `lint` runs the linter for your project
